# Sentra - SIEM+CTI
Sentra - From "Sentinel" (watchguard) + "Central" (hub for logs)

*Python-Django SIEM*

A lightweight, real-time Security Information & Event Management system built entirely in Python + Django.
Designed for continuous development and live log monitoring from multiple sources â€” similar in spirit to big siem type tools, but Sentra is fully custom-built.
